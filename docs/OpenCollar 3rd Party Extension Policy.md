OpenCollar 3rd Party Extension Policy
=====================================

Part of OpenCollar being "open" means that we aim to provide a platform that
people can easily integrate with.  We encourage people to create their own
products, tools, extensions, or services that integrate with OpenCollar.
You're even free to charge money for them.  There are a few ground rules
though:

1. Any scripts containing OpenCollar code must use the GPL license and remain
full perms in SL.
2. You must be very very clear that your product/service/whatever is not
affiliated with or supported by the OpenCollar project. Users must not be
confused about who they're trusting.
3. You must not advertise in the OpenCollar groups.  Our groups prohibit all
advertising.  There is no exception for products that integrate with OpenCollar
in some way.

(We may add to those rules if we missed something important or see people
trying to pick loopholes in them, but that's it for now.)

We are eager to welcome creators willing to follow these rules.  We want to
support your creativity by giving you a solid platform to build on, and we want
you as part of our community.

For now, violations of these rules will be dealt with through group ejection
and public shunning.  We may in the future create a directory of third party
products and services that we trust.  Violators of these rules will be
forbidden from being on that list.
