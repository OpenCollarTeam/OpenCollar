Hi all,

So people in OpenCollar Chatter seem pretty concerned about the changes coming in version 3.7 of the collar, particularly about the loss of the server side features.  This note is to help answer questions that have come up more than once.

Q: What's happening?

A: OpenCollar is turning off the server components that support saving settings
to an online DB and sim-to-sim remote control.  We're still going to run the
server components of the update/distribution system, however.

Q: What features are we losing because of the database switchoff?

A: Online storage of collar settings, and sim-to-sim remote control.

Q: Why?!

A: The OpenCollar server code runs on Google App Engine.  We've had a pretty
good run on App Engine, getting free hosting and having to do almost no system
administration, and had very high uptime for an application that's under
constant load.  But Google is raising their prices and taking us out of the
free quota range.  At first we thought this would raise our hosting costs to
around $200 USD/month, but Google subsequently [adjusted their plans] [1],
which took the cost down quite a bit.  With that and some tweaks of our own
we're looking at around $30/month, though that will spike up when we release
new versions.

Q: When is this happening?

A: The Google price changes are taking effect on Oct 31.  We plan to put 3.7
into the auto update system at least a week before then.  (You might have heard
me say Oct. 1 before.  I was misremembering.  Thankfully.  The real drop-dead
date is Oct 31.)

Q: Why don't you just raise the money inworld?

A: This involves a lot of administration that just isn't practical right now
given the number of people on the OC team and the amount of time they're able
to commit.

Q: What will happen if I just keep using version 3.600?

A: When we put 3.7 in the update system you'll start getting nagged to upgrade.
When we turn off the server components, you'll start seeing error messages.

Q: Can I just run a copy of the database on my own server for my own use?

A: Yes.  BUT:

1. You would need to set up your own instance of our code, (on [Google App
Engine] [2] or maybe [Appscale] [3] ), or fork it to run on your stack of
choice.
2. You would need to fork the LSL settings script to use your server.
3. You would start with an empty database.

Q: Can I donate use of my server to run the main OC database?

A: Probably not.  Both because our code is designed to run on App Engine (not
your bog standard PHP server), and because we are extremely careful about who
we entrust with our users' data.

Q: THIS IS THE END OF OPENCOLLAR!! AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!

A: /me hands you a valium.

Q: Will the server features ever come back?

A: Maybe.  If/when they do, it will only be if we can afford to pay for the
hosting and have sysadmins in place to keep it running smoothly.  This might
mean charging a small fee for people who want the online features.  We don't
have the infrastructure or team for any of that right now, so don't plan on
server features until there's more news.

Q: How can I help support OpenCollar?

A: I'm glad you asked!  Here are some ideas:

- Join the OpenCollar R&D group.  When a beta gets sent there, test it out.  If
  you file a bug on our tracker, IM Nirea about it.
- If you're a scripter, dive in and learn the collar's systems (auth, settings,
  menu hooks) and join in the current effort to make the collar's core simpler
and better documented.
- If you're a designer, consider making something beautiful and useful that you
  can donate to the project.  Those who have made particularly significant
contributions are featured with their own section at the main OC temple.
- If you know how to read and write, ask Nirea how you can contribute to
  improving OpenCollar's documentation.  Make that double if you have html,
css, or web design skills.
- If you're a nice person, consider becoming an official OpenCollar Helper.
  Helpers hang out at the temple from time to time and answer questions.

One last thought: OpenCollar usually presents itself as a team project rather
than any one person's efforts, but these days the team is looking pretty thin
(1 active person, 3-4 less-active people)  It's normal, and totally acceptable,
for people to move on when their life situations or even just their interests
change.  But that means we need a steady stream of new people stepping up, and
that's where you come in.  If you have the means, and have the desire, this is
your opportunity.  OpenCollar only lives as long as its community sustains it.
