### Pardon Our Dust

The OpenCollar founders have recently split the project from the for-profit VirtualDisgrace project that had been joined to it for the last few years.  We're optimistic that this split will be a healthy change for both projects in the long run, avoiding the conflicts of interest that have at times undermined OpenCollar's values of being a free, open, and non-profit community.  Some parts of this repository may still contain VirtualDisgrace-specific links or wording.  Those will be cleaned up.  In the meantime, we encourage you to dive in and help!  Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/issues).  Pull requests welcome.

### Welcome to OpenCollar

OpenCollar is a set of LSL scripts and other creative content, such as animations, sounds, textures, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices in the form of scripted accessory and/or so-called HUDs.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became everyone's script set of choice to create items that are used for creative role play amongst adults in Second LifeÂ®.

**A few words on authorship, years and copyright:**

OpenCollar source code has been composed by many different authors and while not all authors composed something in every year since 2008, we chose to state copyright as year spans (i.e. Copyright (c) 2008 - 2017) in our copyright notice.

We chose to do that in order to save space in a already cramped screen environment with in-world LSL editors. Nevertheless, we tried our best to make all authors appear in order of appearance if read from left to right. <3
