### Welcome to OpenCollar!

OpenCollar is a set of LSL scripts and all sort of creative content, such as motions, sounds, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices for the metaverse. Traditionally such devices would take form as graphical interface worn on the "HUD" or as fashion accessory worn on the avatar herself.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became the basic standard device for this kind of creative role play amongst adults on Second Life®. OpenCollar is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html "What is free software?").
