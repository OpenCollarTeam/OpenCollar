### Welcome to OpenCollar Six™

OpenCollar Six is a set of LSL scripts and other creative content, such as animations, sounds, textures, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices in the form of scripted accessory and/or so-called HUDs.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became everyone's script set of choice to create items that are used for creative role play amongst adults in Second Life®.

#### Finding your way around this repo

At the moment this repository is separated into resources, source code and (now deprecated) web queries. The directory names are self-explanatory and each has a readme attached that tells about specific details. Resource subdirectories inform which file formats we work with and point to other free software that can be used to create such content.

**A few words on authorship, years and copyright:**

OpenCollar source code has been composed by many different authors and while not all authors composed something in every year since 2008, we chose to state copyright as year spans (i.e. Copyright (c) 2008 - 2017) in our copyright notice.

We chose to do that in order to save space in a already cramped screen environment with in-world LSL editors. Nevertheless, we tried our best to make all authors appear in order of appearance if read from left to right. <3
