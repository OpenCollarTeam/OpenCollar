## The OpenCollar Remote

###### A graphical user interface for ease of access to OpenCollar scripted devices.

Formerly "OpenCollar Owner HUD", the API Six variation is vastly slimmed down and more resource friendly. There are also a lot more buttons on the device itself. The new button textures can be found in the ./res directory of this repo and are available share-alike.
