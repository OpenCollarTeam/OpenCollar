Let's work on the Owner Hud!
===========================

Early Goals:
------------

- Clean up orphaned code in the scripts.
- Provide better commentary/documentation.
- Arrange things to make it more easily for a broader spectrum of people with various skill levels to contribute to this project!

- Find someone else then wendy101 with greater skill in programming to take on pull requests, keep code in-sync with their disk and the in-world device.


That means in the future the repository to send pull request to etc. will be help by someone else.
Until then everyone is welcome to fork and clone here.

Stay tuned!
