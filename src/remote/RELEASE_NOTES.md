# OpenCollar Remote HUD Release Notes

## 1.5

- Switched from separate textures per button to a faster loading single sprite
  sheet.  Moved oc_remote_options' functionality into oc_remote_sys.
- Add new Detach button for quick access to OpenCollar 7.1's new detach
  feature. (It's the button with the person's pants coming off.)
- Added buttons for Lock and Titler.
- Removed buttons for Gag, Blindfold, and Cuffs.
- Fixed all unused and/or shadowed variables and functions.
- Fixed the Rez function so that objects will always be rezzed in front of the
  wearer.
- Fix Positioning when attached to a different point
