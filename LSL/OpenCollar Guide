OpenCollar is a set of scripts for a collar similar other collars common in SL.  Unlike those systems however, OpenCollar is open source.  You are free to copy and redistribute the OpenCollar scripts, provided that you leave them full perms.  Read the entire OpenCollar License in the notecard accompanying the scripts.

The OpenCollar architecture is plugin-based, allowing for many more features to be added in the future.  Features not found in other collars include:

- complete, menu-driven support for the Restrained Life Viewer.
- ability to automatically punish the sub for saying any word from a list you specify.
- optional Group control (in addition to owners and secowners)
- menu-driven color and texture setting
- automatic updates
- and best of all, free and open source!


Please report any bugs you find or feature requests to the OpenCollar bug tracker at http://code.google.com/p/opencollar/issues.


**Important**  OpenCollar automatically sets the command prefix to the wearer's initials.  Use the wearer's initials before all the commands below.  For example, if Greta Grumpsalot were wearing the collar, she would prefix all commands with her initials "gg", such as saying "ggowner". If you have a newer "resident" surname, then Greta resident will have the initials "gr" which would become "growner" instead of "owner".  Use the "prefix" command to change the prefix if you want one other than the default initials.

To give a command to two subs at once, use a * in place of the prefix.  For example, *kiss would make all the subs near you give you a kiss, if you have some degree ownership in their collars (owner, secowner, or group).

=====notes======
visit, http://www.erestraint.com/realrestraint/ to get the restrained life viewer that fits your system best
this Note card will help you with the set up and installation of the RLV(windows only, works with windows Vista)􀀀.
To start using them the wearer of the collar has to be using the Restrained Life Viewer (RLV) and the features have to be enabled (if the collar did not manage to activate them during the log on which happens when logging in in a zone where running scripts is not allowed or due to huge lag).
To activate the features open the main menu and click on RLV.
If the collar did not manage to realize that the RLV is running on log-in then you will find a button called *Turn On*.
Press this one to activate the RLV features. You will receive a message if the collar was able to find the RLV or not. If the collar found the appropriate client the main RLV menu will be available from now on.
If the collar managed to find the RLV on log-in you will find the main RLV menu at this point.
