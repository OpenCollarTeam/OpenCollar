OpenCollar License
----------------------

[In-World Notecard Object of the GPLv2]

The OpenCollar scripts are licensed under the GPLv2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt), with the following addendum:

Throughout this license the term "authors" refers to Nandana Singh, Lulu Pink, Garvin Twine, Cleo Collins, Wendy Starfall, Satomi Ahn, Joy Stipe, Medea Destiny, littlemousy and other contributors to OpenCollar - submission set free.

"Full perms" means maintaining the modify, copy, and transfer permissions in Second Life. If the Second Life platform should allow more fine-grained permissions in the future, then "full perms" will mean the most permissive possible set of permissions allowed by the platform.

The OpenCollar scripts are free to be copied, modified, and redistributed, subject to the following conditions:

    - If you distribute the OpenCollar scripts, you must leave them full perms. (This includes using the scripts in collars that you make.)
    - If you modify the OpenCollar scripts and distribute the modifications, you must also make your modifications full perms.

Custom plugins that are entirely created by you, and which communicate with the OpenCollar scripts only through link messages, are not subject to the above restrictions.

The OpenCollar hug and kiss scripts were originally created by Francis Chung, with only slight modifications by Ilse Mannonen. To the best of our knowledge, they are in the public domain.

To the best of our knowledge, the animations included in OpenCollar which were not created by the authors (which is most of them), may be used without restriction. Animations created by the authors as well as animations created by Marine Kelley which are named arch, bendover, booty, cutie, display and kneel as of version 3.940 must remain full perms. If you created one of the included animations and would like to have it removed, please notify Wendy Starfall.

Likewise, all textures included in the OpenCollar that were not created by the authors are, to the best of our knowledge, free to use for any purpose. The textures included which were created by the authors must remain full perms. If you created one of the included textures and would like to have it removed, please notify Wendy Starfall.

The base OpenCollar object (in which the OpenCollar scripts are placed) must also remain full perms. (If you want to use the OpenCollar scripts in collars that you have made and wish to sell, you can restrict copy or trans permissions on your prims, but you must leave the OpenCollar scripts full perms).

3rd Party Extension Policy
------------------------------

Part of OpenCollar being "open" means that we aim to provide a platform that people can easily integrate with. We encourage people to create their own products, tools, extensions, or services that integrate with OpenCollar. You're even free to charge money for them. There are a few ground rules though:

1. Any scripts containing OpenCollar code must use the GPL license and remain full perms in SL.
2. You must be very very clear that your product/service/whatever is not affiliated with or supported by the OpenCollar project. Users must not be confused about who they're trusting.
3. You must not advertise in the OpenCollar groups. Our groups prohibit all advertising. There is no exception for products that integrate with OpenCollar in some way.

(We may add to those rules if we missed something important or see people trying to pick loopholes in them, but that's it for now.)

We are eager to welcome creators willing to follow these rules. We want to support your creativity by giving you a solid platform to build on, and we want you as part of our community.

For now, violations of these rules will be dealt with through group ejection and public shunning. We may in the future create a directory of third party products and services that we trust. Violators of these rules will be forbidden from being on that list.
