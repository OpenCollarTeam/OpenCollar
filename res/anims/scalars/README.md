## Scalars

###### This space is for scalar animations.

Scalar animations are poses that exclusively alter the hip joint in the second frame of the animation. Currently we use this for "fixing" height-offset problems. This will never be a real solution to z-offset challenges but is a nice band-aid to have for now.

To prevent the collar from listing an animation in the pose menu, we can add a tilde in front of the pose name.
* i.e. ~-30.bvh
