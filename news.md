OpenCollar 3.930 RELEASED

If you missed the auto-update, you can get an updater if navigating to Help/Debug in your collar menu and clicking Get Updater. Updaters are also available at the official locations at Keraxic and Qandico, as well as from the many network vendors found across the grid and on the marketplace. With this version we are closing the gap in between the beta and main channel. If you haven't already you really should update!
