# OpenCollar 3.8 is here! - 20121112.1

Hello everybody. A few highlights on this new release.

On the user point of view:

1. When a dialog button has a too long label (long avatar name, long folder name... ),
full text for all choices will appear in the chat console.

2. New 'Actions' submenu in #RLV Browsing, proposing to choose between adding
and replacing folders and even locking them. 2 icons before each folder name for complete
worn status.

For developpers and designers:

1. Revamped link message map. A command chain is now authed only once. New plugin template:
https://github.com/SatomiAhn/ocupdater/blob/3.8/lsl/OpenCollar%20-%20plugin%20template.lsl

2. "touch" helper API. Different actions on touching different prims of a collar can be set,
either by prim description or using an API similar to that of the dialog helper.
